# Emacs tips

I'll put there the emacs tips I came to use when I do stuff in
Emacs in general and more specifically editing Scheme.

# Use Paredit

Parentheses in Scheme are cool. They delimit expressions without
ambiguity, allow homoiconicity and stuff. But when you spent a
whole day dealing with parentheses, all those advatages are
shadowed by petty drawbacks. Paredit precisely here for that : do
interesting things without getting lost in parentheses.

My favorite way of installing stuff in emacs is with ELPA system.
Once done, you only have to add : (require 'paredit) in your config
file to begin to walk the steep learning curve of Paredit. It's
much less steep if you have the (cheat
sheet)[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PareditCheatsheet] near you.
